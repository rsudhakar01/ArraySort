# Array Sorter

# Description
This is an array sorter program which sorts an array of length 'n' inputted by the user. If the user wishes a random array of that size can be generated for them and sorted. Depending on the user's input choice they can use different types of sort to sort the array. 

# Instructions 
Enter the length of the array you wish to be sorted. Input 'G' to generate a random array of that length, or input all the elements of the array manually. The program will print your array before it gets sorted. Choose the type of sort you want (Bubble, Quick, Merge, etc.) to sort the array. The program will print the partially sorted array at each stage and finally the completely sorted array.
Note: The program will not be able to print the array in the algortihms which utilize recursion due to confusing numbering, i.e, in Merge and Quick sort.
